## Latest
2023.02.14 Update <a href="https://github.com/carushi/ParasoR/wiki">wiki</a> to include the detail of Radiam (simulation of point mutation).

## Features 
ParasoR computes a variety of RNA secondary structure features for long RNA sequences even for human genome-level sequences by distributed computation using computer clusters.

Currently availabel features of ParasoR are
* Base pairing probability (bpp)
* Stem probability
* Accessibility (loop probability)
* Structure profiles (probability and motif sequence)
* Single-core mode: Minimum free energy (MFE) structure γ-centroid structure
*  Multi-core mode: Maximum expected accuracy structure, which consists only the base pairs whose bpp is equal larger than 1/(1+γ))

* γ-centroid structure with the color code of structure profiles.
* Color: Exterior (light green), Stem (red), Bulge (orange), Multibranch (green), Hairpin (violet), Internal (blue).

Additionally, ParasoR simulates structure arrangements caused by a single point mutation.

## Requirements

* C++11

We already tested ParasoR running with Apple LLVM version 6.0 and GCC 4.8.1.

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/carushi/ParasoR
cd ParasoR
./configure
make
make install
```

Another way without git is downloading the directory directly from "Download ZIP" button.

As a default, a 'double' option is valid for the precision of floating point.
This setting can be changed by editting the line in the makefile as below.

```
make VAR=LONG
# use long double.
make VAR=SHORT
# use float.
```

If you have a trouble about automake setting, please try a handmade makefile as shown below.

```
cd src
make -f _Makefile
```
or

```
 autoreconf -ivf
```

## Example
A shell script 'check.sh' can be used for a test run.
This script is exected by typing the commands as follows.

```
cd script/
sh check.sh
cat ../doc/pre.txt
# stem probability based on previous algorithm (Rfold model)
cat ../doc/stem.txt
# stem probability based on ParasoR algorithm
python test.py
# Output numerical error between the result of ParasoR with single core and multiple core
```
